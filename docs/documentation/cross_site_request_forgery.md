## QRadar API CSRF

QRadar APIs use a CSRF token to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities. The QRadar CSRF token is generated by QRadar and
then added to API calls and HTTP requests as a cookie or header with the key `QRadarCSRF`.

If an app makes requests to the QRadar API, it must use this `QRadarCSRF` token to pass CSRF checks. The token
is stored as a cookie so it can be retrieved either through JavaScript or by your app's backend reading the cookie from
an HTTP request to it. This is done automatically by the [QJSLib](https://github.com/IBM/qjslib) and
[QPyLib](https://github.com/IBM/qpylib) libraries when making HTTP requests to the QRadar API.

## CSRF in apps

If targeting QRadar versions 7.3.3 FixPack 9 and above apps can make use of [QRadar CSRF to protect
endpoints](./qradar_csrf.md).

Apps should implement CSRF protection, with the recommended approach using
[WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/) and [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to
handle generating CSRF tokens and validating them. See '[Adding CSRF protection](../tutorials/adding_csrf_protection.md)' to see how to use Flask-WTF with a QRadar app.
